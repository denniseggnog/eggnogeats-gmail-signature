Create an email signature for my social media channel.

GMail signatures require html and in-line CSS. 

One challenge I had was figuring out how to host the pictures in google drive. After some research, I found the solution was to change the public sharing link url from:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/193FVwsnm5YwBRnqljz3SdSlj_SByJ91m/view?usp=sharing

to:

https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=193FVwsnm5YwBRnqljz3SdSlj_SByJ91m
